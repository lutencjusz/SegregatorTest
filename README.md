# SegregatorTest
The prepared tests were based on the Selenide + Cucumber Library.
They were equipped with a selenide element factory based on the JSON file (src/test/resources/SelenideElements.json).
The test is based on the Segragator service available at https://master.d3f6907mja6s04.amplifyapp.com/.
